# Source Snap
Automatically add colorful 'code snippet' Featured Images to WordPress posts.

## Installation
Make sure Imagick's enabled and able to read PDF files. Unpack in `wp-content/plugins`. Optionally, add your TinyPNG API account's details.

## Usage
Create/edit a blog post. Add some code to a `source_snap_snippet` custom field and publish/update! The post's Featured Image will be set to the source code 'snapshot'. Try explicitly adding the language in a `source_snap_lang` custom field. (Some autodetection is supported.)
