# Source Snap
Automatically add colorful 'code snippet' Featured Images to WordPress posts.

## Installation
Make sure Imagick's enabled and able to read PDF files. Unpack in `wp-content/plugins`. Optionally, add your TinyPNG API account's details under Settings > Source Snap.

## Usage
Create/edit a blog post. Use the Source Snap meta box to add a code snippet (up to 11 lines should do). It's probably best to specify the language, too. Finally, hit publish/update! The post's Featured Image will be set to a colorful 'snapshot' of your code.
